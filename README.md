# MS_MPA_surfzone

This repository contains code and analyses to recreate the manuscript "Responses of Surf Zone Fish Communities to Marine Protected Areas".
This manuscript investigates the how surf zone fish respond in community composition, richness, abundance and biomass to MPA protections in the California MPA network. For a full description of the methods see manuscript or description of data in DataOne portal. 

1) The code found here shows how the data is set up and summarized from the raw data (available in an online portal). 

2) Runs example linear analyses and generates corresponding figure.

Data is available electronically in the California Ocean Protection Council DataONE portal: Jenifer Dugan and Michelle Marraffini. 2022. California coast, ecosystem surveys of sandy beaches and surf zones August 2019-February 2020. California Ocean Protection Council Data Repository. doi:10.25494/P6989J.
